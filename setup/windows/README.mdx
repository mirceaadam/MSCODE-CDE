### INSTALLATION STEPS:

#### 1. Download, unzip, prepare installation.

1. Open Powershell AS ADMINISTRATOR
2. RUN the following commands in succesion:
```
mkdir C:\Temp\devops
cd C:\Temp\devops
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/mirceaadam/MSCODE-CDE/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" -OutFile "C:\Temp\devops\MSCODE-CDE.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "./MSCODE-CDE.zip" -DestinationPath "./MSCODE-CDE"
```

#### 2. START THE INSTALLATION:

Next, RUN the following two commands with 
**[A] - YES TO ALL !** :
```
cd C:\Temp\devops\MSCODE-CDE\MSCODE-CDE-main\setup\windows
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass 
.\1.ps1
```

#### 3. Observations:
- it will perform in total: 2 restarts (1 automatically , last one asks nicely)
- if it does not continue automatically, after the 1st install, then run manually:
```
./2.ps1
./3.ps1
```
- follow the instructions in the powershell installer window that opens up.


#### 4. If you installed Docker and you want to use the container:
