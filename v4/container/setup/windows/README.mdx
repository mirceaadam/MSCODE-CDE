### INSTALLATION STEPS:

#### 1. Download, unzip, prepare installation.

1. Open Powershell AS ADMINISTRATOR
2. RUN the following commands in succesion:
```
mkdir C:\Temp\devops
cd C:\Temp\devops
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/mirceaadam/MSCODE-CDE/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" -OutFile "C:\Temp\devops\MSCODE-CDE.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "./MSCODE-CDE.zip" -DestinationPath "./MSCODE-CDE"
```

#### 2. START THE INSTALLATION:

Next, RUN the following two commands with 
**[A] - YES TO ALL !** :
```
cd C:\Temp\devops\MSCODE-CDE\MSCODE-CDE-main\setup\windows
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass 
.\1.ps1
```

#### 3. Observations:
- it will perform in total: 2 restarts (1 automatically , last one asks nicely)
- if it does not continue automatically, after the 1st install, then run manually:
```
./2.ps1
./3.ps1
```
- follow the instructions in the powershell installer window that opens up.


#### 4. If you installed Docker and you want to use the container
-> additional configuration is required to have a perfect experience
### a) establish a working directory
1. Open Powershell AS ADMINISTRATOR
2. type:
``` bash ```
Next, Establish a preffered working directory!
In this example I will create a folder called "work" under `/mnt/c/Users/[YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME]`.
In the command below, replace "[YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME]" with your windows user.
```
cd /mnt/c/Users/[YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME]
```
Then run this:
    ```
    mkdir work && cd work
    ```
##### b) configure `~/.aws`
###### b.1: if you already have an `~/.aws` saved then, just copy it to:
-  `~/.aws` if WSL
-  or `C:\User\[YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME]\.aws` if using windows explorer
###### b.2: if you don't have it, you have to configure it. 
- in `~/.aws` for linux
- in `C:\User\[YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME]\.aws`
- in this repository, `.aws-example` is an example of credentials
- just replace: `xxxxxx` in `config` and `credentials`

### c) configure user.settings file of this setup
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mirceaadam/MSCODE-CDE.git && cd MSCODE-CDE
    cp setup/user.config-example ../user.config && cd ..
    ```
- next, customize the variables in `user.config` replace `john.doe` with your name:
    
    [ CONTAINER-SPECIFIC ]
    - CONTAINER_NAME="MY-AWEOSAME-CDE" `#the name that will be displayed in MSCODE`
    - CONTAINER_LOCAL_IMG="mscodecde:latest" `#a random name for your docker image`
   
    [ AWS ]
    - AWS_SETUP="yes"
    - AWS_IAM_USERNAME="john.doe"
    - AWS_ARN_OF_MFA="arn:aws:iam::12345678910:mfa/john.doe" `#add your mfa ARN from IAM from your AWS user` 
    - AWS_TOKEN_DURATION=129600
    
    [ GIT ]
    - GIT_SETUP="yes"
    - GIT_EMAIL="john.doe@company.com"
    - GIT_USERNAME="John Doe"

### d) run the setup
    ```
    cd MSCODE-CDE
    chmod +x setup.sh
    bash setup.sh && cd .. && code .
    ```     
- `Note:` the script will delete the cloned repo at the end.
