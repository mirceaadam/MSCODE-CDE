# MS CODE CUSTOM DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
# MSCODE-CDE v3.0
- It's a custom development environment based on containers so that that it can be easy to share between machines and teams across different operating systems.
- The main goal is to have the same env and same tools in MSCode.
- Current main tools: 
    - check `image/.Dockerfile` 
    - git, aws-tools(awscli, MFA, ecs, k8s, etc.), cdk v2, etc.
